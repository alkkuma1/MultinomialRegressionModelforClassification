## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MultinomialRegressionModelforClassification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
cd MultinomialRegressionModelforClassification
```
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook MultinomialRegressionModelforClassification.ipynb
```
The notebook walks through the entire process of building, training, and evaluating a Multinomial Regression model for digit classification using the MNIST dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, which is loaded directly from the TensorFlow/Keras library. The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
```bash
MNIST = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
```

## Model
The model implemented is a Multinomial Logistic Regression model, which is trained on the MNIST dataset to predict the digit represented in an image. The main steps include:

Loading and preparing the dataset
Defining the model using TensorFlow
Training the model using cross-entropy loss
Evaluating the model's accuracy on test data

## Results
After training the model, its performance is evaluated based on accuracy metrics, and the results are visualized using confusion matrices and plots of model performance.
